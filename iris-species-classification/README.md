# 🌸 Iris Species Classification

A simple machine learning project that identifies the species of an Iris flower based on its measurements.
The project compares multiple models and selects the best one based on accuracy.

---

## 📁 Dataset

Iris dataset (from sklearn)
It contains 150 samples with:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Target Species (3 classes)

---

## 🎯 Key features 

- Loads and preprocesses the Iris dataset
- Trains four classification algorithms
- Compares accuracy of each model
- Displays performance side by side
- Visualizes the final Decision Tree
- Predicts species from custom user input

---

## 📊 Models Compared

Four different models were trained and tested.
Their accuracy scores are:

| Model                            | Accuracy |
| -------------------------------- | -------- |
| **Decision Tree Classifier**     | **97%**  |
| **Logistic Regression**          | 96%      |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**    | 96%      |
| **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** | 97%      |

## 🏆 Best Model:

The Decision Tree Classifier was selected as the final model because - 

- It achieved one of the highest accuracy scores
- It is easy to understand and interpret
- The full tree structure can be visualized clearly

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates that multiple models can classify Iris species effectively. Among them, the Decision Tree provided the highest accuracy and was chosen as the final model.
